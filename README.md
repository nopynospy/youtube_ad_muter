# YouTube Ad Muter

YouTube and its creators make money from ads, but some ads can be very loud and give viewers jump scares.

This extension mutes ad videos (almost) as soon as they pop up.

Now you can support your favourite creators without using ad-blocks while saving yourself from jumpscares.

Note: this is still being tested.

Original boilerplate taken from https://github.com/JasonXian/react-chrome-extension-boilerplate

## Getting Started

1. `npm i` to install dependancies
2. `npm start` to start running the fast development mode Webpack build process that bundle files into the `dist` folder
3. `npm i --save-dev <package_name>` to install new packages

## Loading The Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Toggle on `Developer mode` in the top right corner
3. Click `Load unpacked`
4. Select the entire `dist` folder

## Production Build

1. `npm run build` to generate a minimized production build in the `dist` folder
2. ZIP the entire `dist` folder (e.g. `dist.zip`)
3. Publish the ZIP file on the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard!

## Initial Steps

1. `git init` to start a new git repo for tracking your changes, do an initial base commit with all the default files
2. Update `package.json`, important fields include `author`, `version`, `name` and `description`
3. Update `manifest.json`, important fields include `version`, `name` and `description`
4. Update `webpack.commmon.js`, the title in the `getHtmlPlugins` function should be your extension name

## Default Boilerplate Notes

- Folders get flattened, static references to images from HTML do not need to be relative (i.e. `icon.png` instead of `../static/icon.png`)
- Importing local ts/tsx/css files should be relative, since Webpack will build a dependancy graph using these paths
- Update the manifest file as per usual for chrome related permissions, references to files in here should also be flattened and not be relative
